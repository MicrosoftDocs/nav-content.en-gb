# <a name="set-up-fixed-assets"></a>Set Up Fixed Assets
Before you can use the Fixed Assets functionality, you must set up various information to define how you insure, maintain, and depreciate fixed assets, and how costs and other values are recorded in the general ledger.

When you have set up Fixed Assets, you can perform the various activities involved. For more information, see [How to: Manage Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).

**Note**: You can record fixed asset transactions in the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** window or in the **Fixed Asset Journal** window, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. Help for Fixed Assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** window.

When you select a check box for a fixed asset activity in the **G/L Integration** section in the **Depreciation Book Card** window, then the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** window will be used to post transactions for the activity in question.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

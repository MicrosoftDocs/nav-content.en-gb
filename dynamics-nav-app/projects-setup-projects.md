# <a name="set-up-project-management"></a>Set Up Project Management
Before you can use Dynamics NAV to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and jobs.

Then you can create jobs and schedule resources for projects as well as manage budgets and track machine and employee hours with time sheets. For more information, see [Manage Projects](projects-manage-projects.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

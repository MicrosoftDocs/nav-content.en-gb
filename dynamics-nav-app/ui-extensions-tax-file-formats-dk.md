# <a name="the-tax-file-formats-dk-extension-for-dynamics-nav"></a>The Tax File Formats (DK) Extension for Dynamics NAV
If you engage in trade with companies, or internal branches or subsidiaries, in other EU countries you must report information about the activities to SKAT and to Statistics Denmark. If you use the VAT and Intrastat reporting features in Finance and Operations, Business Edition, this extension can ensure that the file you export is compatible with requirements from these organisations. The extension adds the MS-ECSL Report Export File and Intrastat Export Lines submission codeunits to your VAT Report Configuration, so you can export data in the new format right away.

The extension is free, you just need to install it.

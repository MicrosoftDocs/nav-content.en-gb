# <a name="design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply"></a>Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply
To understand how the planning system works, it is necessary to understand the prioritised goals of the planning system, the most important of which are to ensure that:  

- Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
- Any supply serves a purpose.  

Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.

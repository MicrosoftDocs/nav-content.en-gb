# <a name="why-is-the-page-is-locked-from-personalizing"></a>Why is the page is locked from personalising?
If there is a lock icon in the **Personalising** banner when you open a page (as shown), this means that you are currently prevented from making any more personalisation changes to the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].

![Personalise Lock](media/personalization-locked.png "Personalise lock")

There can be two reasons for this:
1.  Until now, you have only used the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalise the page.

2. You have used the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] to personalise the page before, but it was done using a [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] or earlier version.   

If you want to continue personalising the page by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], choose the lock icon, and then **Unlock**.

## <a name="what-happens-when-you-unlock-the-page"></a>What happens when you unlock the page
If you choose to unlock the page, the current personalisation of the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] will be cleared, meaning the page will go back to its original layout and you will have to start from scratch.

In the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], the page will remain as it was before and will not be effected by the new changes in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. The personalisation in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] becomes separated, so you will now have a personalised version in each client. 

In the future, you will personalise the page in the two clients separately. Therefore, the page can potentially look different between the two.

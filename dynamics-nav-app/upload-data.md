# <a name="import-data-from-other-finance-systems"></a>Import Data from Other Finance Systems
In Dynamics NAV, you can choose to create an empty company so that you can upload data from other finance-setup systems to use in your new Dynamics NAV. Depending on the finance-setup solution that your business uses today, you can transfer information about customers, vendors, inventory, and bank accounts.
In the Business Owner Role Centre, you can access an assisted setup guide that helps you transfer the business data from an Excel file or from other formats. The type of files you can upload depends on the extensions that are available. For example, you can upload data from QuickBooks because Dynamics NAV includes an extension that handles the conversion from QuickBooks. If you want to upload data from other finance-setup solutions, you must either check if an extension is available for that solution or import from Excel.  
Dynamics NAV includes templates for customers, vendors, and inventory items that you can choose to apply when you upload your data.

If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information to an Intuit Interchange Format (IIF) file. You can then open the assisted setup guide to transfer the data.
For example, if your IIF file includes customers and vendors, you can choose to transfer only the customer data. You can then transfer the rest of the information later.  
The assisted setup includes an option to change the default configuration of the transfer, but we recommend that you only enter this advanced setup if you are familiar with database tables. In the vast majority of businesses, the default mapping from QuickBooks to Dynamics NAV will transfer the information that you want.

# <a name="welcome-to-dynamics-nav"></a>Welcome to Dynamics NAV

Dynamics NAV is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. The demonstration company contains sample data, but you can create your own sales documents, for example, or set up a bank account.  

In the Business Owner role center, you can find the **Assisted Setup & Tasks** action. Here you see a list of assisted setup that can help you getting started. In the **Assisted Setup** window, you will find the following:

|Assisted Setup           |Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Set Up Company           |Creates a new trial company for you to enter data and try our Dynamics NAV. If you went through the Getting Started tour this is probably already **Completed**. |
|Migrate Business Data    |Lets you import your existing company data such as vendors, customers, and items from Excel or Quickbooks.|
|Set Up VAT         |Gets you started with default Tax groups and assigning Tax area codes that you can assign to customers and vendors in order to automatically calculate VAT in sales or purchase documents.|
|Set Up Email             |Gets you ready for sending email messages directly from, for example, sales orders or contacts in Dynamics NAV.|
|Set Up Office Add-Ins    |Sets up the ability to use and launch Dynamics NAV from Outlook.|
|Set Up Approval Workflow|Sets up the ability to automatically notify an approver when a user tries to create or change certain values on documents, journal lines, or cards, such as an amount above a specified limit.|
|Set Up Email Logging     |Sets up the capability to log email correspondence in Dynamics NAV to follow up on interactions.|
|Set Up Dynamics CRM Connection|Sets up a connection to Dynamics CRM which allows you to synchronise data such as contacts and sales order information.|

When you have run an assisted setup, it is marked as **Completed**. To run the assisted setup, you choose the three dots also called the context menu, and then you select **Start Setup**.

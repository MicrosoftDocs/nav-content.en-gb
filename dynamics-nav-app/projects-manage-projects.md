# <a name="manage-projects"></a>Manage Projects
In Dynamics NAV, you can perform common project management tasks, such as configuring a job and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual jobs, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.

Before you can use Dynamics NAV to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and jobs. For more information, see [Set Up Project Management](projects-setup-projects.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

|Create a time sheet with integrated job task and planning lines and post time sheet lines to a job journal.|[How to: Use Time Sheets for Jobs](projects-how-use-time-sheets.md)|
|Budget for resources to be used in jobs and compare actual item and resource usage to budgeted usage to improve the quality and cost efficiency of future projects.|[How to: Manage Job Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md)|
|Review and record usage on various parts of your job, which is automatically updated as you modify and transfer information from job planning lines to job journals or job invoices for posting.|[How to: Record Usage for Jobs](projects-how-record-job-usage.md)|
|Purchase supplies for a job, either on purchase orders or invoices, and record item and time usage.|[How to: Manage Job Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)|

|Post the consumption of materials, resources, and other expenses of job work in process (WIP) to monitor its financial value and to maintain correct financial statements even though you post job expenses before invoicing the job.|[How to: Monitor Job Progress and Performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md)|
|Record job costs for resource usage, materials, and job-related purchases on an on-going basis and invoice the customer, either when the job is finished or according to an invoicing schedule.|[How to: Invoice Jobs](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md)|

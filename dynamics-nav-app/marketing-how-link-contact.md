If you have contact and either a customer, vendor, or bank account for the same company, you can link the two entities. Linking the two entities enables you to synchronise data that is common so that it is the same in both places.

## <a name="link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-or-bank-account"></a>Link a Contact to an Existing Customer, Vendor, or Bank Account
1. Open the contact that you want to link.
2. Choose the **Link with existing** action, and then choose **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank**.
3. Select the customer, vendor, or bank account to link to.

   In the **Current Master Fields**, you specify which fields should prioritise in case of conflicting information in fields common to the contact and customer, vendor, or account. For example, if the salesperson code is different in the contact than the customer, you can decide, by selecting **Contact**, to use the information in the contact.

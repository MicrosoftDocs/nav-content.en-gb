# <a name="how-to-process-sales-returns-or-cancellations"></a>How to: Process Sales Returns or Cancellations
If your customer wants to return or get reimbursement for items or services that you have sold and received payment for, you must create and post a sales credit memo that specifies the requested change. To include the correct sales invoice information, you can create the sales credit memo from the posted sales invoice or use a copy function.

In addition to the original posted sales invoice, you can apply the sales credit memo to other sales documents, for example another posted sales invoice, because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice.

A return or reimbursement may relate to only some of the items or services on the original sales invoice. In that case, you must edit information on the lines on the sales credit memo. When you post the sales credit memo, the sales documents that are affected by the change are reversed and a refund payment can be created for the customer.

You can send the posted sales credit memo to the customer to confirm the return or cancellation and communicate that the related value will be reimbursed, for example when the items are returned.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and the choose the related link.  
2. In the **Posted Sales Invoices** window, select the posted sales invoice that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    Most fields on the sales credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted sales invoice. You can edit all the fields, for example with new information that reflects the return agreement.
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursed.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. In the **Apply Customer Entries** window, select the line with the posted sales document that you want to apply the sales credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action.

    The number of the sales credit memo is inserted in the **Applies-to ID** field.  
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if smaller than the original amount.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** window, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.  
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the sales credit memo, it will be applied to the specified posted sales documents.

    When you have created or edited the needed sales credit memo lines and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can proceed to post the sales credit memo.
8. Choose the **Post and Send** action.

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialogue box opens showing the preferred sending method for the customer. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document** to field. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed, and a refund payment can be created for the customer. The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos.

# <a name="across-business-areas"></a>Across Business Areas

Dynamics NAV provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance-setup and sales. And to support your business area-specific tasks, you can use a variety of general business functionality, such as **Number Series** and **Extensions**, which is available across these areas.

The following table lists these general business areas with links to topics that describe them.

|To   |See   |
|-----|------|
|Assign unique identification codes to records, such as general ledger accounts, customer and vendor accounts, invoices, and documents. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easy to analyse and can reduce the number of errors that occur in data entry.|[Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md)|
|Set up standard text codes so you can extend standard text by adding extra lines, and set up conditions for use of the extra lines.|[How to: Define Extended Text](ui-how-define-ext-text.md)|
|Change Dynamics NAV by installing extensions that add functionality, changes behaviour, or gives you access to new online services.|[Customizing Dynamics NAV Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md)|
|Learn how to work with general journals, which are used to post to general ledger accounts and other accounts such as bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts.|[Manage General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md)|

# <a name="process-incoming-documents"></a>Process Incoming Documents

To record an external document in Dynamics NAV, you must first create or complete an incoming document record. You can do this manually, or you can take a photo of the external document and then create the incoming document record with the image file attached.

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in Dynamics NAV. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** window. Alternatively, you can send the file to the OCR service by email. Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically. After some seconds, you receive the file back from the OCR service as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor.

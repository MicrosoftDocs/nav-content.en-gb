If you purchase from a vendor in one currency and submit payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the purchase.

Likewise, if you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the sales invoice.

The following procedure describes how to set this up for vendor ledger entries in the **Purchases & Payables Setup** window. The setup is similar for customer ledger entries in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** window.

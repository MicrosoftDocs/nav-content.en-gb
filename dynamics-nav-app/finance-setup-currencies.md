# <a name="currencies"></a>Currencies
You must set up a code for each currency you use if you buy or sell in currencies other than your local currency, have receivables or payables in other currencies, or record G/L transactions in different currencies.  

## <a name="set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service"></a>Set Up a Currency Exchange Rate Service
You can use an external service to get the latest currency exchange rates into the Currencies window. To update currency exchange rates, you must first set up the service.
The service that provides updated currency exchange rates is enabled by a data exchange definition in the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** window.

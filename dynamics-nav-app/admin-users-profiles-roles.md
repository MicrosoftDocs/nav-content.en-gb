# <a name="users-profiles-and-role-centers"></a>Users, Profiles, and Role Centres
The people in your company who have access to [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] are all assigned a *profile* that gives them access to a *Role Centre*. As an administrator, you can assign and change profiles in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], and you can add and remove users as part of your [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] subscription.  

## <a name="adding-users"></a>Adding Users
To add users in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], your company's Office 365 administrator must first create the users in the Office 365 Admin Centre. For more information, see [How to: Manage Users and Permissions](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

## <a name="profiles"></a>Profiles
Profiles are collections of [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] users who share the same Role Center. A Role Centre is a type of page on which you can place different parts. Each part is a container in which you can host other pages or pre-defined system parts, such as an Outlook part or parts for adding tasks, notifications, or notes. For more information, see [Managing Profiles](admin-profiles.md).

## <a name="configuration-and-personalization"></a>Configuration and Personalisation
The concept of UI customization in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] is divided in two:  

-   Configuration, performed by the administrator  

    The administrator configures the user interface for multiple users by customising the user interface for a profile that the users are assigned to. For more information, see [Configuring the User Interface for Users](admin-configure-user-interface.md). 

-   Personalisation, performed by users  

    Users personalise the user interface of their personal version by customising the user interface under their own user logon. This personalisation can be deleted by the administrator. For more information, see, [Personalising Workspaces](ui-personalization-overview.md).

# <a name="how-to-define-check-layouts"></a>How to: Define Cheque Layouts

You can design your cheques to conform with the standards set by the local authorities. Cheque images can be printed in English, French, or Spanish.

Cheques are designed to print in both the United States and Canadian cheque image formats in either a cheque-stub-cheque format or a stub-stub-cheque format.

## <a name="to-define-check-layouts"></a>To define cheque layouts
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and choose the related link.
2. In the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** window, in the **Usage** field, select **Cheque**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID   | Report Name   | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
|1401|Cheque|This is the default report.|
|10401|Cheque (Stub/Stub/Cheque)|This report is designed to print cheques in a stub/stub/cheque format.|
|10411|Cheque (Stub/Cheque/Stub)|This report is designed to print cheques in a cheque/stub/cheque format.|

When you have set up cheque layouts, you can print cheques from the **Payment Journal** window. For more information, see [Work With Cheques](payables-how-work-checks.md).

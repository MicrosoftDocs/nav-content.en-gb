# <a name="defining-user-tasks"></a>Defining User Tasks
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organisation.  

## <a name="managing-user-tasks"></a>Managing User Tasks
The **User Tasks** window shows all tasks, and you can easily create and assign new tasks. When you create a task, you can specify the start date and due date, and you can add a link to the window in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] where the user must do the work.  

For example, you can create a task for yourself to view all posted sales invoices. In that case, you link the task to page 143, Posted Sales Invoices.

> [!TIP]  
>  Use the look-up in the **Page** field and then use the **Search for Page or Report** field to find the page that you want. For more information, see [Searching for a Page or Report](ui-search.md).  

### <a name="picking-up-user-tasks"></a>Picking Up User Tasks
In the Business Manager, Bookkeeper, and Accountant Role Centres, a tile shows pending tasks that are assigned to that user. To pick up a task, simply choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the window where you can do the work.  

When you have completed a task, simply mark it as completed.  

### <a name="deleting-user-tasks"></a>Deleting User Tasks
If you want to bulk delete all or some user tasks, you can use the **Delete User Tasks** report. In the request page, you can set filters to determine which tasks must be deleted.

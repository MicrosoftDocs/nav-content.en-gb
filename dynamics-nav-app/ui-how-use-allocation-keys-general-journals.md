#  <a name="how-to-use-allocation-keys-in-general-journals"></a>How to: Use Allocation Keys in General Journals
You can allocate an entry in a general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be made by quantity, percentage, or amount.

## <a name="to-set-up-allocation-keys"></a>To set up allocation keys 
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Recurring General Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** window.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
  * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
  * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you are done, close the window. A new, empty recurring journal opens. 
6. Fill in the fields in the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action. 
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you are allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** window. The **Allocated Amt. (GBP)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.
